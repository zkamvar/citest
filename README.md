# citest

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zkamvar/citest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zkamvar/citest)

The goal of citest is to test the function `utils::citation()`

## Example

I was having trouble with poppr on travis ci, and Jim Hester
[pointed me to a commit in R-devel] that might be causeing the 
hubub. This package investigates that by testing the citation
function in the vignette
